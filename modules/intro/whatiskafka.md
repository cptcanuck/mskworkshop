# What is Kafka and MSK

![logo](_media/kafka_overview.svg)

## Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source, high performance, fault-tolerant, and scalable platform for building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications. Apache Kafka is a streaming data store that decouples applications producing streaming data (producers) into its data store from applications consuming streaming data (consumers) from its data store. Organizations use Apache Kafka as a data source for applications that continuously analyze and react to streaming data.

## MSK

Amazon MSK is a new AWS streaming data service that manages Apache Kafka infrastructure and operations, making it easy for developers and DevOps managers to run Apache Kafka applications on AWS without the need to become experts in operating Apache Kafka clusters. Amazon MSK is an ideal place to run existing or new Apache Kafka applications in AWS. Amazon MSK operates and maintains Apache Kafka clusters, provides enterprise-grade security features out of the box, and has built-in AWS integrations that accelerate development of streaming data applications. To get started, you can migrate existing Apache Kafka workloads into Amazon MSK, or with a few clicks, you can build new ones from scratch in minutes. There are no data transfer charges for in-cluster traffic, and no commitments or upfront payments required. You only pay for the resources that you use.
