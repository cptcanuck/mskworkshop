# MSK Workshop

This workshop is intended to deploy the following items during the labs

- A cloud9 environment 
- A simple 3 node MSK cluster
- A tooling system where you'll do most of your work
- An Elasticsearch cluster to connect to and stream data
- An S3 bucket to stream data to and from

These modules, other than the first 2, can be done independantly and don't build on each other.
