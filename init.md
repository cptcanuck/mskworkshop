# MSK Workshop

This workshop is intended to deploy the following items during the labs:

* A simple 3 node MSK cluster

* A "kafka jumpbox" where you'll do most of your work
* Additional nodes added to your 3 broker cluster
* Deploy the Open Monitoring stack (prometheus and Grafana)

You will also expand the storage on your MSK cluster.  Many of these activities can be done in the console or via the cli, pick whichever interests you more.



**Note** that as you go through this workshop, there will be some values (such as broker lists, zookeeper lists, cluster ARNs, etc) that you will need over and over.  We suggest you keep a file with these details to make the labs smoother.  Run through the [common tasks](/modules/commontasks/overview.md) to gather this information.
